Sure — here’s a prompt you can use to continue seamlessly:

---

**Prompt:**

> I want to continue improving my `ZeroSync` backup app. You've already helped me build the full app with:
>
> * A splash screen using `logo.png`
> * Tray icon using `icon.ico`
> * Admin permissions using a manifest
> * GUI with source, backup, and exclude folder sections
> * `robocopy` for backup, correctly excluding folders
> * Permanent path saving in `%APPDATA%\ZeroSync`
>
> Now I want to:
>
> 1. \[Add your next goal here, like scheduling, logging, backup history, etc.]
> 2. \[Optional: Improve appearance, packaging, auto-start, etc.]

Please give me updated code or next steps for these.

Just replace the numbered items with whatever features or changes you want next, like:

* “Add a daily scheduler with time picker”
* “Include backup logs and show success/failure”
* “Add dark mode toggle”
* “Make tray icon have a right-click backup option”
* etc.
```
